# mds-rock-paper-scissors

This project takes the classic game of rock, paper, scissors and takes it ONE STEP FURTHER!!!

The project uses socket.io (websockets) to match players, make match decisions and relay those decisions back to the players, players can win, lose or draw.

Both projects are written in TypeScript, the front-end is written in Angular and the server is a node application.

This application is written just as a little bit of fun, and as a teaching aid, feel free to fork it and make your own version, or play along if you happen to catch one of my livestreams at https://www.twitch.tv/programminginprogress or watch highlights and previous recorded streams at https://www.youtube.com/user/ProgrammerInProgress
